# Action-to-Talk Project: CNN Model Training and Deployment

This repository contains the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to recognize hand gestures and translate them into spoken language for the Action-to-Talk project.

---

## **Overview**

The Action-to-Talk project aims to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. This component focuses on building a CNN model to recognize static hand gestures corresponding to alphabets, numbers, and certain commands, translating them into text or speech.

---

## **Steps in the Process**

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**

- **Source:** The dataset used comprises labeled images of hand gestures for each alphabet and specific commands such as "space" and "delete."
- **Structure:** Each class of gesture was stored in a separate folder, and the dataset was programmatically loaded and processed.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Images were resized to 96x96 pixels for uniformity.
  - Colors were converted from BGR to RGB using OpenCV.
  - Labels were numerically encoded corresponding to the folder indices.

**Code:**
```python
image = cv2.imread(file_path)
image = cv2.resize(image, (96, 96))
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
image_array.append(image)
label_array.append(i)
```

---

### 2. **Data Splitting**

- The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 85%-15% ratio with `train_test_split` to ensure the model generalizes well.

**Code:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(image_array, label_array, test_size=0.15)
```

---

### 3. **Model Architecture**

The EfficientNetB0 model was chosen for its computational efficiency and high accuracy. Additional layers were added for fine-tuning:

- **EfficientNetB0 (Base):** Used as a feature extractor.
- **GlobalAveragePooling2D:** To reduce dimensionality while retaining key features.
- **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
- **Dense Layer:** Provides the final output for classification.

**Code:**
```python
model = Sequential()
pretrained_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(input_shape=(96, 96, 3), include_top=False)
model.add(pretrained_model)
model.add(layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D())
model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))
model.add(layers.Dense(1))
```

---

### 4. **Model Compilation**

The model was compiled with the following configurations:
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Metrics:** MAE

**Code:**
```python
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mae", metrics=["mae"])
```

---

### 5. **Model Training**

- **Epochs:** 20
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Callbacks:** 
  - `ModelCheckpoint` for saving the best model.
  - `ReduceLROnPlateau` for adaptive learning rate reduction.

**Code:**
```python
history = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, validation_data=(X_test, Y_test),
                    batch_size=32, epochs=20,
                    callbacks=[model_checkpoint, reduce_lr])
```

---

### 6. **Model Conversion**

After training, the model was converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for mobile deployment, optimizing it for real-time use.

**Code:**
```python
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
with open("gesture_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

---

## **Evaluation**

The model achieved a low validation loss and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), demonstrating its ability to generalize effectively. Training and validation metrics were monitored to ensure balanced learning.

---

## **Deployment**

The optimized TFLite model was integrated into the Action-to-Talk mobile app, enabling users to capture gestures via the camera and receive real-time translations into text or speech.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- Increase dataset diversity with augmented data.
- Incorporate dynamic gesture recognition for continuous signing.
- Extend support to multiple languages using NLP for text-to-speech conversion.
